# ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Daniel, nice to meet you
I am a mechanical engineer with a passion for app development and data science! I love data analysis, manipulation, and uncovering interesting insights. I also enjoy developing apps that add value to the projects i'm working on.

I enjoy automating the boring stuff that makes me go :sleeping:, especially if it can add value to the projects i'm working on.
I try and make everything I code accessible to everyone so feel free to use any of the code that I upload (just don't forget to give credit :wink:).

## Currently working on...
Currently I am working on various data science projects. I find data fascinating and extracting useful information from it is a  challenging but rewarding task. I really enjoy creating different predictive models and try and maximize their predictive capibilites on unseen data.

#### Don't hesitate to contact me for any questions / suggestions / complaints, I would love to hear from you.
