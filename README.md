# ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Daniel, nice to meet you
I am a mechanical engineer with a passion for coding and data! I love data analysis, manipulation, and uncovering interesting insights.

I enjoy automating the boring stuff that makes me go :sleeping:, especially if it can add value to the projects i'm working on.
I try and make everything I code accessible to everyone so feel free to use any of the code that I upload (just don't forget to give credit :wink:).

## Currently working on...
Currently I am working on "Reddit emotions" which is an interesting web app that gives insight into what reddit likes and doesn't like. The coding is mostly done in python and django as a web framework but also includes frontend coding.
I try to make the app as streamlined and seamless as possible, hopefully people will enjoy it, go check it out!* :smile:	

*The app will be deployed soon, stay tuned!

#### Don't hesitate to contact me for any questions / suggestions / complaints, I would love to hear from you.
