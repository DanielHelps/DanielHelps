# ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Daniel, nice to meet you
I am a mechanical engineer with a passion for coding, and about data! I love looking at data, manipulating it, and figuring out interesting insights about it.

I enjoy automating the boring stuff that makes me go :sleeping:, especially if it can add value to the projects i'm working on.
I try and make everything I code avaliable to everyone so feel free to use any of the code that I uploaded (just don't forget to give credit :wink:).

## Currently working on...
Currently I am working on "Reddit emotions" which is an interesting web app that tries and give insights regarding what reddit likes and what it doesn't like. The coding is mostly done in python and django as a web framework but includes also frontend coding.
I try to make the app as streamlined and seamless as possible, hopefully people will enjoy it, go check it out!* :smile:	

*The app will be deployed soon, so it will be accessible as a website for everyone.

#### Don't hesitate to contact me for any questions / suggestions / complaints, I would love to hear from you.
